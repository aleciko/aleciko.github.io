				<h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY!</h1>
				<p>Even though we can't be together for your birthday, I hope you know how much I love and miss you!</p> <br>
				<p>You have been such an inspiration to me throughout my life with your courage and love. I've always known that no matter what happens or what I do, you will always be there for me, to pick me up, dust me off and hold my hand. Having your unconditional love has helped me grow into the person that I am today and I am so thankful to have you as my mum <span class="fa fa-heart"></span> It's been hard to be apart for so long, but I hope you are enjoying the warmer weather in New York and spending time with the boys.</p><br> 
				<p>I love you with all my heart. I hope that you have a lovely day and get properly spoiled. You deserve it!</span><p><br>
