				<h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY!</h1>
				<p>I've written you a proper card so I won't say too much here.</p> <br>
				<p>You have been such a huge part of my life for so long and I have no idea who I would be without you. I absolutely adore you and I hope that you know how loved you are! We've been through a lot together and I hope that we will continue to be friends until we're grumpy old ladies. Happy Birthday gorgeous girl, I hope you have an amazing day with Ari and your family and I can't wait to see you tonight! <span class="fa fa-heart"></span> </p><br> 
				<p>I love you with all my heart!</span><p><br>
